           <h1 id="background">Background</h1>
<p>In the early days of computing, software was often distributed (this
is before the World Wide Web) with its source code because many software
at the time was hardware-specific. This meant that the user had to
modify the source code so that the software they bought would work with
their hardware. It’s hard to fathom this practice in 2021; however, back
in the 1970s, computers were reserved for researchers and experts.
Though not to that extent, some older generation PC gamers might
remember having to choose a specific audio hardware in the game menu for
the sound to work properly. So the idea of hardware-agnostic software is
fairly new. While it is more convenient for end users for a piece of
software to simply work regardless of their hardware, this meant that
software had to become more complex and expensive to produce. Companies
started to hide their source code in order to protect their work and
stop competitors from copying their implementation. Many computer users
at the time were unhappy about this change and this ultimately led to
the foundation of the Free Software Movement and the <a
href="https://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation (FSF)</a> by
Richard Stallman.</p>
<h1 id="the-four-essential-freedoms">The Four Essential Freedoms</h1>
<p>According to the FSF, a program is free if the program's users have
the following four freedoms:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.</li>
<li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does
your computing as you wish.</li>
<li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others.</li>
<li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to
others.</li>
</ol>
<p>Access to the source code is a precondition for items 2 and 4. The
FSF classifies software that do not grant users these four freedoms as
nonfree and unethical. Check out <a
href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">this post</a> by the
FSF that goes into much more detail about their philosophy.</p>
<h1 id="what-about-open-source">What about Open Source?</h1>
<p>It’s easy to assume that open source software is also free, but this
is not the case. The <a href="https://opensource.org/">Open Source
Initiative (OSI)</a> defines open source software as software that meet
the following 10 criteria:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Allows free redistribution of the software by itself or as a
component of a bigger software package.</li>
<li>Allows distribution of source code without charge or for no more
than a reasonable reproduction cost (cost of physical media such as USB
drive or CD).</li>
<li>Allows modification and derived works and allows them to be
distributed under the same terms as the original.</li>
<li>May restrict distribution of source code only if the license allows
the distribution of patch files with the source code for the purpose of
modifying the program at build time.</li>
<li>Must not discriminate against any person or group of persons.</li>
<li>Must not restrict anyone from making use of the program in a
specific field of endeavor.</li>
<li>Applies the rights attached to the program to all to whom the
program is redistributed.</li>
<li>Must not limit the license of the program to a particular product if
the program is bundled in a larger product package (think of programs
bundled with an operating system).</li>
<li>Must not restrict other software that is distributed with the
licensed software.</li>
<li>Must be technology-neutral (platform-agnostic).</li>
</ol>
<p>Criteria for Open Source Software laid out by the OSI does not fully
agree with the four essential freedoms laid out by the FSF. For example,
OSI allows the license of a software to restrict the distribution of
source code to protect the integrity of the author (item 4) as long as
the license allows the distribution of patch files to go with the source
code. On the other hand, Free Software must give users the freedom to
distribute modified code without the need to protect the original
author’s code. Even though not all open source software is free, the
FOSS community at large uses the term FOSS to indicate both free
software and open source software.</p>
<h1 id="why-is-this-important">Why is this important?</h1>
<p>If you search “free software” into your favorite search engine (be it
DuckDuckGo, Google, or Searx), you are most likely to get software that
doesn’t cost any money and not libre software. This tarnishes the
reputation of truly free software. When people think of “free software”,
they usually think of freeware or junkware that are often riddled with
ads or they associate the term with malware posing as a legitimate
software.</p>
<p>FOSS allows users to inspect the inner workings of the program to
check whether it is doing what it is supposed to be doing. Sure, not all
of us are trained programmers or computer scientists. However, the open
source nature of FOSS allows anyone (not just the user) to inspect the
code. If anyone tries to plant something nefarious, it won’t take long
for someone to find out about it. This, in my opinion, generally leads
to higher quality software that is more secure and privacy-focused.</p>
<p>Another advantage of FOSS is that it invites and encourages
collaboration and innovation. Many authors welcome users and others to
contribute code to their projects. If someone doesn’t like the direction
or choice a certain program made, they can create a copy and modify the
bits they don’t like. A famous phrase in the FOSS community is: “If you
don’t like it, fork it!” Forking refers to creating a different version
of a software. I believe that this environment of collaboration and
innovation is the reason behind the rise of FOSS over the past few
years. Some popular FOSS projects include Android (the operating system
that runs on essentially all smartphones excluding iPhones), Linux (an
overwhelming majority of the world’s servers and supercomputers run
Linux), Chromium (the engine behind the Chrome web browser), Firefox, R
(as well as R studio), and countless more.</p>
<p>Some of you may wonder how these big projects fund themselves. Surely
it costs money to hire programmers and host websites to distribute these
software. Well, notice that neither the FSF nor the OSI prohibit the
developers from charging fees for offering professional support. This is
how most big FOSS projects fund themselves. Companies like Canonical and
Red Hat offer support for their enterprise customers who run Linux
servers. R Studio has an enterprise license that makes deploying R
server easier. It is important to note that FOSS projects typically do
not prohibit users from accessing these enterprise features. If I am
willing and have the necessary background knowledge, I can deploy R
server on my home server without paying for it. What you pay for is the
professional support or server space to host the R server. Other large
projects such as Chromium are funded by large corporations. The majority
of medium to small sized projects take donations from users or remain
“hobby-grade” and are provided "as-is" without any professional
support.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>I truly believe that FOSS is the future of computer software. There
will always be proprietary software, especially for highly specialized
equipment. However, companies are starting to realize that FOSS is not
only economically viable but also profitable. Not having to pay
royalties or license fees is a huge advantage FOSS has over proprietary
enterprise software. Check out the links below to find the right FOSS
