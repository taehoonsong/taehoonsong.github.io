           <p>A few weeks ago, the privacy-focused messaging app <a
href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a> tried to purchase some ads on a
popular social media platform. You can see examples in <a
href="https://signal.org/blog/the-instagram-ads-you-will-never-see/">their
blog post</a>, which show that the platform and advertisers can target
you based on your occupation, personal preferences, location, major life
events, and probably more.</p>
<p>Signal was ultimately unable to launch this ad campaign because their
advertiser account was blocked by the platform. It’s not surprising to
see that the social media platform doesn’t want its users to see what is
collected. This platform is not alone or unique in collecting massive
amounts of user data. Big tech giants have been trying to collect as
much user data as possible. This process of collecting user data is
often called telemetry.</p>
<p>Telemetry is not inherently bad or evil. It used to be (and still is)
a tool for developers to gather information on its users to focus their
development and bug fixing endeavors. For example, if you find a bug in
your software that occurs when a specific combination of hardware is
used, you would like to know how many of your users have that set of
hardware. If it’s a majority of your user base, you should prioritize
fixing that bug; otherwise, maybe focus your time and effort on other
features. Sometimes, user telemetry data might provide more insight into
where and why the bug might be occurring.</p>
<p>Then, someone figured out that they could use telemetry to gather
more user data and use it for generating targeted ads. The modern web
was born. I’m simplifying a bit here, but companies that provide
services for free generally relies on income from advertisers. Think
about an online service that doesn’t cost any money. You should
immediately wonder how they’re paying for running their servers or
paying their employees. Companies that don’t rely on user data as their
main source of income will usually disclose how they’re generating
income (donations, grants, etc.), with a relatively simple privacy
policy page. On the other hand, companies that primarily rely on ad
revenue (by selling user data directly or by selling targeted ad spots)
will generally not disclose how they’re making money and have extremely
convoluted privacy policies. After all, it costs money to run services
and <strong>if you’re not paying for the service, you’re not the
customer; you are the product.</strong></p>
<p>I’m not advocating for either business model. What I’m advocating is
that the users should be able to easily tell whether they are the
customer or whether they are the product. Users should also be able to
know what types of information is being collected. They might be ok with
sharing their preferences and location, but probably not their medical
records. Then, they can make an educated decision about what services to
use. You might be comfortable with sharing your information in order to
use an email service for free, though the privacy policy will be
intentionally vague when it comes to <em>exactly</em> what you’re
sharing . Some might be uncomfortable and decide to switch to an
alternative provider that costs out-of-pocket payments. I specifically
say “out-of-pocket” payments because the <em>free</em> services are not
ultimately free. You’re effectively selling your user data. That’s a
very personal matter and you need to make your own decision whether that
is an acceptable trade for your situation.</p>
<p>Digital privacy is even more important outside the advertising space.
It can prevent government entities from targeting political dissidents
and members of the press. It can protect asylum seekers and victims of
violence from exposing their location. I want to preemptively say to
those thinking, “I have nothing to hide.” It’s not about having
something to hide; it’s about having reasonable protections for your
personal space. Would you leave your door open because you have nothing
to hide or because you have no valuables in the house? No, you wouldn’t.
Digital privacy is exactly like a lock on your door. Hopefully, only
people you let in will come through the door. Determined actors will get
through, but that should be illegal with strong privacy laws. Most
importantly, <strong>it’s not crazy or paranoid to lock the door in
order to protect your privacy</strong>. However, it is important to
notice that privacy and convenience are at odds with each other. So, you
should consider your threat model (are you trying to avoid spam and
advertising or are you targeted by nation states?) and try to balance
out your need for privacy and your need for convenience.</p>
